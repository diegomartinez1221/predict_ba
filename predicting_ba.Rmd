#Data Acquisition and Data Checking
I began by taking an overall look at the data in the batting.csv. I first checked for any NA values in any of the columns. These could negatively affect a model, thus if there are any, I would like to know. 
```{r fig.height= 2, fig.width=3}
batting%>%mutate(`Any Na` = apply(batting, 1, anyNA))%>%
  count(`Any Na`)%>%
  gt()

```
From the looks of it, I will not have to worry about filling in any Na values and the data is complete for every player.
